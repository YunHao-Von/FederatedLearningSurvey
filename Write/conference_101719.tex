\section{Introduction}
The rapid development of digital technology has made the diversification and informationization
of digital data the main topics of the current era. Meanwhile, deep learning (DL) has
demonstrated tremendous success in multiple fields, including computer vision, natural language
processing, and graphic networks. Clearly, using diverse data in deep learning models can effectively
improve their ability. However, collecting diverse data may invade people's privacy and there is also a growing interest in data privacy protection,
such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\cite{b1}. On the other hand, data sources may
encounter the challenge of distributed storage, as is the case with data from mobile smart devices
or Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios\cite{b2},\cite{b3}. Therefore, utilizing these data to train models requires
overcoming limitations related to distribution and privacy\cite{b4}.

To solve these problems, federated learning(FL) is a machine learning paradigm proposed as a possible response to these
challenges\cite{b5}. As shown in Fig.\ref{fig1}, FL enables collaborative model building among distributed members while ensuring sensitive data remains
within each participant's control\cite{b6}. Specifically, federated learning allows two or more participants to collaboratively
train a shared global DL model while keeping their training datasets locally. Each participant trains the shared model on its own
training data and exchanges and updates model parameters with other participants. Federated learning can improve the training speed
and the performance of the shared model while protecting privacy of the participants' training datasets\cite{b7}. Thus, it is a promising
technique for the scenarios where the training data is sensitive (e.g., medical records, personally identifiable information, etc.) \cite{b8},\cite{b9}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/f1.png}}
    \caption{A schematic of federated learning.}
    \label{fig1}
\end{figure}

Federated learning can be classified based on whether the participating datasets are similar, resulting in two types: homogeneous federated
learning  and heterogeneous federated learning \cite{b10},\cite{b11}. In homogeneous federated
learning, all participants have datasets with the same characteristics and data distribution, whereas in heterogeneous federated learning,
participants' datasets may differ in their characteristics and data distribution. The second classification of federated learning is based
on whether the models involved are the same, resulting in two types: horizontal federated learning and vertical
federated learning\cite{b12},\cite{b13}. In horizontal federated learning, all participants have the same model architecture, but may
have different local data\cite{b14}, while in vertical federated learning, each participant has a different model architecture and they collaborate on
processing own portion of the input data\cite{b15}. The third way to classify federated learning is based on the type of task involved, resulting in several
types such as federated learning for clustering\cite{b16},\cite{b17}, federated learning for classification\cite{b18},\cite{b19}, federated learning for regression\cite{b20}, among others.
The fourth way to classify federated learning is based on the optimization approach used between the participants, resulting in several types such as
federated averaging\cite{b21},\cite{b22}, federated learning optimization, federated meta-learning\cite{b23}, and so on.

    \caption{The robust threat to federal learning}
    \label{fig2}
\end{figure}

Federated learning methods currently face significant challenges related to their robustness. This article focuses on three main attacks, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig2},
including backdoor attacks\cite{b24},\cite{b25},\cite{b26},\cite{b27},\cite{b28},
adversarial attacks\cite{b31},\cite{b32},\cite{b33},\cite{b34}, and Byzantine attacks\cite{b29},\cite{b30}.
In Fig.\ref{fig3}, a backdoor attack involves malicious participants in the federated
learning process adding a backdoor to the model being trained, which can be triggered by a specific input pattern,
allowing the attacker to control the output of the model in a targeted way. Adversarial attacks, on the other hand, entail adding small,
carefully crafted perturbations to the input data to deceive the model and cause it to make incorrect predictions\cite{b31},\cite{b32} as shown in Fig.\ref{fig4}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/f3.jpg}}
    \caption{Backdoor Attack}
    \label{fig3}
\end{figure}

And adversarial attacks can occur in federated learning when a malicious participant intentionally sends adversarial examples to the central server in an attempt to bias the model
towards their own interests. This can be particularly problematic in applications such as personalized advertising or credit scoring, where the malicious participant may be motivated
to gain an unfair advantage. Finally, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig5}, Byzantine attacks involve one or more malicious participants in the federated learning process sending incorrect or misleading updates to the
central server to disrupt the training process\cite{b35}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/f2.png}}
    \caption{Adversarial Attack}
    \label{fig4}
\end{figure}

It is important to carefully consider these rubust and security issues when designing and implementing federated learning systems\cite{b38},\cite{b39}.
While federated learning can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks, there are techniques and approaches that can be used to improve the robustness and security of the process.
For instance, knowledge distillation is a technique that can mitigate backdoor attacks by training a smaller\cite{b36},
distilled model using the output of the original model as the target labels.
This can help remove any backdoor triggers that may have been added to the original model, as the smaller model won't be able to identify them.
Another technique to mitigate backdoor attacks is model erasure\cite{b44}, where the model is trained to ignore specific input patterns that may be associated with the backdoor.

Adversarial training is a technique that involves explicitly training the model to resist adversarial examples
by adding adversarial perturbations to the training data\cite{b31},\cite{b32}.
This can improve the model's ability to detect and resist adversarial attacks in federated learning settings.

Clustering can be used to identify malicious clients in federated learning systems subject to Byzantine attacks\cite{b35},\cite{b36}.
The idea is to group participating clients based on the similarity of their updates, and to identify any clients whose updates are significantly different from the others.
These clients can then be excluded from the training process, or their updates can be treated with greater suspicion to minimize the impact of their malicious behavior\cite{b37}.

    \label{fig5}
\end{figure}

This article provides an overview of these attacks and defense methods in federated learning, aiming to enhance the credibility and security of federated learning.
While previous work has addressed the security of federated learning\cite{b39},\cite{b40},\cite{b41},\cite{b42},\cite{b43}, it has primarily focused on privacy leakage or backdoor attacks,
with relatively few studies and reports on adversarial attacks. Building on prior work, this paper summarizes the attacks and defense methods of adversarial, backdoor,
and Byzantine attacks in federated learning. A new classification method is proposed, supplementing the deficiencies of previous work on adversarial attacks.
Moreover, this paper investigates a multi-level defense system against these attacks, and identifies open problems and future research directions for improving
the robustness of federated learning.

\section{Threat Model}
Prior to delving into the details of the threats to federal learning, it is essential
to establish the connections between these threats based on different criteria.
Specifically, we can categorize these threats into two main stages:
the training phase and the inference phase. Additionally, we can
differentiate between untargeted attacks and targeted attacks based
on whether a specific target is present or not.\cite{b38},\cite{b39},\cite{b40},\cite{b41}.

\subsection{Training Phase and Inference Phase}
\subsubsection{Training Phase}Attacks that occur during the model training process are
intended to either disrupt or impact the federated learning model itself. Backdoors are
inserted into the model during the training phase to influence the resulting model outcomes\cite{b45},\cite{b46}.
On the other hand, Byzantine attacks disrupt the convergence of the model by utilizing malicious
clients or servers\cite{b29}.
\subsubsection{Inference Phase}Attacks that occur during the reasoning phase are
typically intended to alter the model's reasoning outcomes and deceive it
into generating incorrect outputs\cite{b47}. During the training stage, backdoor
attacks involve the insertion of a backdoor into the model, whereas
input deception models with triggers are utilized during the
reasoning stage to cause the model to generate incorrect results.
Adversarial attacks, on the other hand, leverage the model's vulnerability
to disturbances and utilize samples with adversarial perturbations as input
to the model, causing it to produce erroneous outcomes.

\subsection{Untargeted and Targeted}
\subsubsection{Untargeted attack}Untargeted attacks are designed to compromise
the integrity of the target model in an arbitrary manner.
Byzantine attack is one form of an untargeted attack that involves
uploading malicious gradients to the server in an arbitrary manner,
with the goal of causing the global model to fail\cite{b48},\cite{b49},\cite{b50},\cite{b51}.
\subsubsection{Targeted Attack}A targeted attack is executed with
the aim of inducing the model to produce the target label specified by the
adversary for specific testing examples, while keeping the testing error for
other testing examples unaffected\cite{b51}. Backdoor attack is a typical application of targeted attack.

\section{Backdoor Attack}
A backdoor attack on deep neural networks entails surreptitiously implanting
a malicious backdoor within the model. This enables the model to function
normally when processing benign inputs, but triggers a pre-defined
malicious behavior when presented with a specific malicious trigger.
The first neural backdoor in centralized settings can be traced
back to 2013\cite{b52},\cite{b53}.

Due to the unique nature of federated learning, whereby the model is trained
on individual clients, it is more susceptible to backdoor attacks compared
to the general centralized training model. These types of attacks in federated
learning can be divided into two categories based on the different stages at
which the adversary inserts the backdoor into the training pipeline: data
poisoning attacks and model poisoning attacks.

\subsection{Data Poisoning Attack}
In data poisoning attacks, it is assumed that the adversary has full control
over the training data collection process of compromised clients. Then the poisoned
dataset typically consists of a combination of clean data with ground-truth labels
and data with backdoor triggers that have targeted labels.

\subsubsection{Invisible Poisoning}
In this context, the term "invisible" denotes the user's ability to execute
a backdoor attack on a sample without requiring any additional actions to
be performed on the sample itself.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/f6.jpg}}
    \caption{Label Flipping}
    \label{fig6}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.\ref{fig6}, label flipping is a widely recognized attack in centralized machine learning (ML),
as demonstrated in previous research studies\cite{b54},\cite{b55}. In addition,
it is also a suitable method for the federated learning (FL) scenario,
given its adversarial goal and capabilities\cite{b56}.As shown in the picture,
some of the samples labeled "dog" are flipped to "bird" and the samples of "cat"
are flipped to "bread".


Nevertheless, the label flipping technique has its limitations since it necessitates
modifying the label of the sample, making it less practical. Thus, an attack
technique that is more covert and can deceive manual inspection would be more
appealing in this scenario.As shown in Fig.\ref{fig7}, clean-label attack preserves the label of the poisoned data,
and the manipulated image still appears to be a benign sample\cite{b57},\cite{b58}. This type of attack
leverages feature collision, where the crafted poison examples continue to
resemble the source instance in visual appearance, while being closer to the
targeted instance in the latent feature space.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/f7.jpg}}
    \caption{Clean Label Attack}
    \label{fig7}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Visible Poisoning}
Early methods of  backdoor attacks in federated learning can rely on a single trigger,
meaning that all corrupted clients inject the same trigger into their local
training dataset. The triggers employed in this method are usually predetermined,
such as a square located at redundant pixels in the image. During reasoning,
the inserted trigger is used on a malicious client to activate the aggregation model\cite{b24},\cite{b27}.
While the effectiveness of inserting the backdoor has been shown to be significant,
the aforementioned approach merely transfers backdoor attacks from centralized
learning directly to federated learning, without fully leveraging
the distributed nature of the latter. This is
because the same trigger is embedded in all adversarial clients.

Xie et al. \cite{b59} proposed a distributed backdoor attack (DBA) that decomposes a global t
rigger pattern, similar to a centralized attack, into local patterns and embeds
them into different malicious clients. Compared to traditional methods that insert
the same trigger, DBA is more efficient and covert due to its hidden local
trigger mode, making it easier to bypass robust aggregation rules.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/f8.jpg}}
    \caption{Distributed Backdoor Attack}
    \label{fig8}
\end{figure}

In order to enhance the effectiveness of data poisoning attacks,
dynamic triggers have been proposed and applied. Salem et al \cite{b60} conducted a
clear and systematic study on the feasibility of dynamic flip-flops,
which can facilitate the backdoor attacks by generating antagonistic
network algorithms to create triggers. This way, the same tags can be
hijacked with different trigger patterns that share similar potential
representations and positions. Et al \cite{b61} also conducted a direct
investigation of dynamic triggers.

These triggers can be flexibly produced
during the attack phase, as they maintain their effectiveness even
under substantial changes. The results of the study show that dynamically
triggered backdoor attacks are more powerful, and they require new techniques
to be defeated because they break the static trigger hypothesis of most current
defense systems.

Despite the potential threat of data poisoning attacks in federated learning,
they face many practical limitations due to the unique distributed characteristics of this approach\cite{b25}.
This is because the data distribution and model aggregation steps in federated learning tend to neutralize
most of the contributions of the backdoor model, leading to rapid forgetting of the backdoor by the global model.
In light of this situation, Wang et al.\cite{b25} proposed selecting poisoning samples from edge data to reduce the
forgetting effect caused by model updating.

Dai et al.\cite{b64} proposed a new backdoor attack called Chameleon,
which enables attackers to create more persistent visual backdoors by adapting
to peer-to-peer images. The durability of the backdoor largely depends
on the existence of two types of identical benign images that are closely
related to the toxic image: 1) interferers, which are images that share
the same original tag as the toxic image, and 2) facilitators, which are
images with the target back tag. Interferers can cause update conflicts
between toxic updates and benign updates, which may reduce the accuracy of
the backdoor. Conversely, facilitators can help reintroduce backdoor
information into the federated learning model and mitigate the catastrophic
forgetting effect after the attacker leaves the training process. Inspired by
these observations, Chameleon is designed to amplify these effects and enhance
the durability of the backdoor.

\subsection{Model Poisoning Attack}
To address the limitations of data poisoning attacks, we can not only focus on
improving the data poisoning technology itself, but also explore the potential
of model poisoning techniques. Since the average method is the most widely-used
approach for aggregating local updates from clients, a simple way to amplify
the backdoor effect is to prioritize updates from adversarial clients over
those from benign clients.

Bagdasaryan et al.\cite{b24} proposed the first backdoor attack against federated learning.
Their approach involves training a backdoor model that closely resembles the global
model, which is then used to replace the latest global model.
To improve the effectiveness of this replacement, they slow down
the learning rate to extend the lifespan of the backdoor model, and add an
anomaly detection term to the loss function to avoid detection. This
strategy requires careful evaluation of the global parameters and performs
better when the global model is close to convergence.

Zhou et al.\cite{b63} proposed an optimization-based model poisoning attack that
involves injecting adversarial neurons into the redundant space of a neural network
to maintain the attack's concealment and persistence. To identify the redundant
space, the Hessian matrix is used to measure the update distance and direction of each neuron's main task (i.e. "importance").
An additional term is then added to the loss function to prevent poisoned neurons from being injected
in locations that are particularly relevant to the main task.
In a similar vein, Zhang et al.\cite{b62}
proposed a persistent backdoor attack called Neurotoxin. This method
relies on the empirical observation that the norm of a stochastic gradient
is primarily concentrated in a small number of "heavy hitter" coordinates.
Neurotoxin identifies these heavy hitters using the top-k heuristic and
avoids them. By avoiding directions that are most likely to receive large
updates from benign devices, the chance of the backdoor being erased is mitigated.

Sun et al. \cite{b65}proposed a distance-aware attack (ADA), which enhances poisoning attacks
by identifying optimized target classes in the feature space. They addressed the challenge of
limited prior knowledge of customer data that competitors may face. To overcome this problem,
ADA infers the pairwise distances between different categories in the potential feature space
from the shared model parameters using backward error analysis. They conducted an extensive
empirical evaluation of ADA by varying attack frequency in three different image classification
tasks. As a result, ADA successfully improved the attack performance by 1.8 times in the most
challenging cases with attack frequency of 0.01x.

\subsection{Summary Of Federated Backdoor Attack}
The primary challenge of backdoor attacks in federated learning is how
to leverage the distributed nature of this approach, evade detector checks,
and ensure the persistence of the backdoors during multiple rounds of update
iterations. We identify three research directions for federated backdoor
attacks: using multiple malicious clients to insert backdoor attacks,
combining generation technology with backdoor attacks, and conducting
research on persistent backdoor attacks in federated learning.

\section{Defenses against Backdoor Attack}
To mitigate the problem of backdoor attacks in
federated learning, various defensive techniques have been proposed.
Given that we previously categorized backdoor attacks as data poisoning
attacks and model poisoning attacks, we will now discuss defensive strategies
for each of these attack types.

\subsection{Defense Against Data Poisoning}
The simplest approach is to filter out poisoned data samples,
which aims to remove the poisoned samples from the training dataset.
After the filtering process, only benign samples or purified poisoned
samples are used during the training process, thus eliminating the
creation of a backdoor from the source.

Tran et al.\cite{b67} were the first to investigate methods for filtering out malicious
samples from the training set. They demonstrated that poisoned samples tend to
leave detectable traces within the covariance range of the feature representation.
Exploiting this insight, it is possible to filter out poisoned samples from
the training set.Zeng et al. \cite{b68} revealed that poisoned samples of
existing attacks had some high-frequency artifacts even if their trigger
patterns are invisible in the input space. Based on this observation,
they designed a simple yet effective filtering method based on those artifacts.
Similarly, Chen et al. \cite{b69}proposed a two-stage filtering approach.
As shown in Fig.\ref{fig9}, in the first stage, activation values of samples in each class are clustered
into two groups, and in the second stage, it is determined which clusters
correspond to poisoned samples.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.3\linewidth]{picture/two-stage-cluster.png}}
    \caption{two-stage-cluster}
    \label{fig9}
\end{figure}


As is well known, backdoors are triggered during the inference stage.
Filtering out malicious samples from the testing samples during the inference stage can prevent the backdoor
from being activated. Gao et al. \cite{b71} proposed to filter attacked samples by overlaying various image patterns
on suspicious samples. The smaller the randomness of the input perturbation prediction, the higher the probability
that the suspicious sample is attacked. In \cite{b72}, Subedar et al. used model uncertainty to distinguish between
benign and attacked samples. Later, Du et al. \cite{b73} regarded filtering as outlier detection and proposed a
differential privacy-based filtering method. Recently, \cite{b74} proposed a lightweight method that can filter
attacked samples or prior hypotheses of trigger patterns without labeled samples.

However, Tang et al.\cite{b70} demonstrated that
simple target contamination can result in malicious and benign samples being
indistinguishable in the feature representation space. Therefore, most
sample filtering techniques are ineffective.

Based on data-driven defense methods, in addition to filtering out samples,
it is also possible to consider directly preprocessing the samples,
specifically by erasing any backdoors within them to prevent them from being embedded in the model.
Liu et al.\cite{b75} proposed a pre-trained autoencoder as a preprocessor to prevent malicious samples from embedding backdoors
by preprocessing the input samples without affecting data classification accuracy.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/f9.png}}
    \caption{Overview of the Februus System.}
    \label{fig10}
\end{figure}
Doan et al. \cite{b76}proposed a two-stage image processing method called Februus, in which,
in the first stage, Februus uses GradCAM to identify influential regions, which are then
removed and replaced with a neutral color frame. Subsequently, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig10}, Februus uses a GAN-based
repair method to reconstruct the masked regions to mitigate their adverse effects (such as benign accuracy reduction).
Li et al. \cite{b77} discussed the properties of existing poisoning-based static trigger mode attacks. They demonstrated
that the attack performance may sharply decrease if the appearance or location of the trigger is slightly changed.
Based on this observation, they recommended using spatial transformations (such as contraction, flipping)
for defense. Compared to previous methods, this method is more efficient because it requires almost no additional computational cost.

\subsection{Defense Against Model Poisoning}
\subsubsection{Filtering}
Similar to defense methods against poisoned data, defense methods against poisoned models also begin with model filtering.
Fung et al. proposed FoolsGold \cite{b78}, which checks for and eliminates suspicious updates during local updates.
FoolsGold is based on the fact that when a global model is trained by a group of attackers, they will submit updates with
the same backdoor objectives throughout the training process, resulting in similar behavior.

However, this similarity does not occur among honest participants because each user's training dataset is unique and not shared with others.
Therefore, malicious attackers can be separated from benign attackers through gradient updates. After detecting such anomalies,
FoolGold maintains the learning rate of benign users (submitting only unique gradient updates) and reduces the learning rate of malicious users
(repeatedly uploading similar gradient updates) to mitigate backdoor attacks. However, experimental results show that
FoolsGold cannot defend against adaptive attacks.

Li et al. \cite{b79} proposed a spectral anomaly detection framework for a
central aggregator that detects and erases backdoor model updates through strong detection model detection.
The key idea of spectral anomaly detection is that there is a significant difference between the embedding
of benign updates and backdoor updates in a low-dimensional latent space. One practical method for approximating
low-dimensional embedding is to build a model using an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder takes
in the raw update and returns a low-dimensional embedding, and the decoder is fed the embedding and outputs
the generation error.  After training the encoder-decoder model on benign updates, it can be used to identify
backdoor updates, generating errors much higher than benign errors; malicious updates will be excluded from
the aggregation process. However, this defense method cannot handle multi-trigger backdoor attacks, i.e.,
injecting various backdoors simultaneously.

Nguyen et al. proposed FlGuard \cite{b80}, a two-layer defense method that checks
for locally updated updates with clear backdoor effects and eliminates residual backdoors through pruning, smoothing, and noise
addition. Unlike FoolsGold\cite{b78}, it also applies to multi-trigger backdoor attacks while maintaining high prediction accuracy for benign primary tasks.
Additionally, FLDetector \cite{b81} proposed a method to detect malicious clients by checking the consistency of model updates. Essentially,
the server predicts the client's model update based on past updates in each iteration. If the model update received by the client
differs significantly from the predicted update over multiple iterations, the client is marked as malicious. Overall, the focus of
these methods is mainly divided into two types: the first is to remove toxic updates from malicious clients before model aggregation,
and the second is to reduce the impact of malicious clients on the aggregated model, such as reducing the learning rate of suspicious clients.

\subsubsection{Robust Training}
After filtering techniques, another class of techniques aims to directly mitigate backdoor attacks during model training through robust joint training.
Differential privacy algorithms have been shown to be effective against backdoors \cite{b82}, but they may compromise model performance under data imbalance
commonly found in federated learning \cite{b83}. DP-FedAvg \cite{b84} (Central-DP) is a differential private aggregation strategy that eliminates
outliers by clipping the norm of model updates and adding Gaussian noise, but the required amount of noise significantly reduces
task accuracy. Sun et al. \cite{b27} proposed weak DP, which adds sufficient Gaussian noise to defeat backdoors while maintaining task accuracy,
but it is ineffective against constraint-based backdoor attacks \cite{b25}.
Additionally, DP-based defenses can potentially impact the benign performance of the global model,
as the clipping factor also changes the weights of benign model updates.

In addition to DP-based defenses, Andreina et al. \cite{b85}proposed Feedback-based Federated Learning (BaFFle) to eliminate backdoors.
The key idea of BaFFle is to leverage participants to verify the global model. BaFFle includes a super-digit verification process for each
round of federated learning. Specifically, each selected participant checks the current global model by computing a verification function on
their secret data and reports to the central server whether the model is backdoored or not. The central server then decides whether
to accept or reject the current global model based on feedback from all users. The verification function compares the error rate of
a specific class of the current global model with the error rate of previously accepted global models. If the error rate is significantly different,
the central server rejects the current global model as it may be backdoored and issues an alert. Unlike anomaly detection, BaFFle is compliant with secure aggregation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/CRFL.png}}
    \caption{Overview of certifiably robust federated learning (CRFL).}
    \label{fig11}
\end{figure}


Considering that all of the above defense works lack robustness certification,
Xie et al. \cite{b86} proposed the first general defense framework CRFL for training certifiably robust FL models against backdoor attacks.
As shown in Fig.\ref{fig11},CRFL controls the model smoothness through pruning and smoothing of model parameters and generates sample robustness
certification against amplitude-limited backdoor attacks. Smoothness and perturbation methods are also used as an
additional component to constrain the L2 norm of individual updates to enhance defense performance \cite{b87}.

In addition, the FL-WBC \cite{b88} method aims to identify the fragile parameter space in FL and perturb it
during client training. FL-WBC also provides robustness guarantees against backdoor attacks and convergence guarantees for FedAvg.
These developments demonstrate promising steps towards improving FL's robustness against backdoor attacks. In FLARE \cite{b89}, a trust
evaluation method is proposed that calculates a trust score for each model update based on the difference between all model updates and
their penultimate layer representation values. FLARE assumes that most clients are trustworthy and assigns low scores
to updates that are far from benign update clusters. The model updates are then aggregated with their trust scores as
weights and the global model is updated accordingly.

In \cite{b98}, the concept of anti-backdoor learning is introduced, which involves training a clean model given infected data,
dividing the overall learning task into a dual task of learning the clean part of the data and the backdoor part.
The article leverages two inherent weaknesses of backdoor attacks: models learn backdoor data faster than clean data,
and the stronger the attack, the faster the model converges on the backdoor data. Additionally, backdoor tasks are mutually
associated with specific classes. Based on these two weaknesses, a generic learning scheme is proposed to automatically prevent
backdoor attacks during training. A two-stage gradient ascent mechanism is introduced to isolate and separate backdoor samples
from the target class during the early training stage and break the association between backdoor samples and the target class during the later training stage.
\subsubsection{Model Reconstruction}
The model reconstruction-based approach aims to eliminate hidden backdoors in infected models by directly modifying suspicious models.
Therefore, even if triggers are included in the attack samples, the reconstructed model will still correctly predict them because
the hidden backdoors have been removed.

As mentioned earlier, the forgetting mechanism of federated backdoor attacks means that as training and model aggregation progress,
the backdoor will be forgotten in successive iterations. As a defense, this forgetting mechanism can also be utilized to create many defensive methods.

Zeng et al. \cite{b90}defined multiple training as a min-max problem and used implicit hyper-gradients to
explain the interdependence between internal and external optimization.
In \cite{b91}, Zhao et al. showed that hidden backdoors infecting DNNs can be repaired using pattern connectivity techniques with a certain number of benign samples.

Li et al. \cite{b92} perturbed backdoor-related neurons based on the distillation process, reconstructed (infected) DNNs using knowledge
distillation techniques , and thus removed hidden backdoors.
Huang et al. \cite{b109} proposed a distillation technique that utilizes Cognitive Distills to extract Cognitive patterns.
This is because the patterns of backdoor examples are generally small and sparse, making it possible to detect poisoned examples.


In addition to directly eliminating hidden backdoors, defense based on trigger synthesis first
synthesizes backdoor triggers, and then in the second phase, eliminates hidden backdoors by suppressing the influence of triggers.
These defenses have some similarities in the second phase with reconstruction-based defenses. For example,
pruning and retraining are commonly used techniques to remove hidden backdoors in both defenses. However,
compared to reconstruction-based defenses, the trigger-based defenses' trigger information makes the removal process more effective and efficient.

A GAN-based method was proposed in \cite{b93} to synthesize trigger distributions.
In \cite{b94}, they showed that the detection process used in \cite{b95} to determine synthesized
triggers has several failure modes and proposed a new defense method based on this observation.
Additionally, Cheng et al. \cite{b96} revealed that the ∞ norm of activation values can be used to
distinguish backdoor-related neurons based on synthesized triggers. Therefore, they propose performing an
∞-based neuron pruning to remove neurons with high activation values in response to triggers.
Similarly, Aiken et al.\cite{b97} also propose removing hidden backdoors
by pruning DNNs based on synthesized triggers from another perspective.

In general, we do not consider filtering techniques to be a viable solution for mitigating backdoor attacks.
Instead, we believe that the focus of research on backdoor defense should be on model reconstruction and robust training.

\section{Byzantine Attack}
The first type of attack is the Sybil attack.  As shown in Fig.\ref{fig12}, the Sybil attack is a type of network security attack where the attacker creates
multiple fake identities or nodes to undermine the network's trust mechanism and disrupt its normal operation.
The Sybil attack was first proposed by John Douceur in 2002 \cite{b110}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/sybil.jpg}}
    \caption{Sybil attack}
    \label{fig12}
\end{figure}

The principle behind this attack is that the attacker creates a large number of fake identities, nodes,
or accounts that appear independent and genuine to the network but are actually controlled by the attacker.
The attacker can use various means to create these fake entities, including using forged IP addresses, anonymous proxy servers, virtual machines, and more.
This attack was initially introduced in peer-to-peer networks.

The Sybil attack mainly targets systems that rely on trust and identity verification mechanisms, such as peer-to-peer networks, social networks, and blockchains. Attackers can use a large number of fake identities to control the resources of the system, deceive other users, and disrupt consensus mechanisms. For example, in a peer-to-peer network, attackers can create numerous fake nodes to control the distribution process of files, leading to uneven resource distribution or network performance degradation.
Since its introduction, the Sybil attack has posed significant threats to various network security systems.

Bhagoji \cite{b111} explored some attack strategies against deep neural networks by enhancing malicious agent
updates and employing alternating minimization strategies for stealth and adversarial targets. They demonstrated
the possibility of effective and covert model poisoning attacks. Jun \cite{b112} and others were the first to explore the Freerider attack in federated learning and proposed an incremental weight attack method that can evade most defense monitoring methods at that time. They also introduced a new high-dimensional anomaly detection method called STD-DAGMM, which is particularly useful for detecting freeriders. This method has potential applications for detecting other models' weight anomalies as well, which will be discussed in the next chapter.
In recent years, Sybil attacks have undergone significant development.
Attackers employ more advanced techniques to create counterfeit identities, making Sybil nodes more realistic and difficult to distinguish.

For instance, they might use virtualization technology to create multiple independent virtual machines,
each with its own IP address and network identifier. Attackers can also utilize social engineering tactics and information acquisition methods
to disguise themselves as genuine users or obtain additional fake identities through the authorization of legitimate users.
Furthermore, attackers might construct more complex and realistic Sybil networks by leveraging shared information in social networks.

Haonan Yang \cite{b113} focused on the problem of vehicular ad hoc networks and criticized previous studies for only considering the security threats and impacts of Sybil attacks in VANETs without analyzing the potential threats and impacts in VFCs (Vehicular Fog Computing). The author summarized four types of Sybil attacks that could affect VFCs in areas such as routing, vehicle decision-making, voting, and reputation systems.
With the proliferation of mobile devices and the widespread use of wireless networks, Sybil attacks have also started to increase in these environments. Attackers can jeopardize the security of location services, social networks, and mobile applications by utilizing false identities and location information on mobile devices. In the future, Sybil attacks can be more extensively applied to blockchain technology, enabling attackers to manipulate consensus algorithms, launch double-spending attacks, or undermine the fairness of blockchain networks by controlling a large number of counterfeit identities.
The second type of attack is based on the transmission process. Byzantine attacks can occur during the communication process between participants. Attackers can tamper with, delete, or insert malicious messages to disrupt the transmission of model updates.

Linyuan Zhang \cite{b114} proposed a centralized related probability small-scale attack (CDPS), which utilizes additional information.
For example, fusion rules in fault diagnosis \cite{b115} can be known as prior knowledge available for optimizing attack strategies.
One type of CDPS attack is collaborative attacks among malicious users who communicate with each other.
Additionally, information exchange can guide malicious users in designing effective attack strategies.
Generally, colluding malicious users \cite{b116},\cite{b117} first exchange measurement values to ensure more accurate
decisions on the licensed channel state and then report the coordinated forged results to enhance attack power.
Moreover, Omid Fatemieh introduced another attack model called the full-knowledge attack \cite{b118}.
Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is considered a promising method for identifying available spectrum.

However, it not only requires a significant amount of communication resources but also introduces vulnerabilities to Byzantine attacks.
Jun Wu \cite{b119} mentioned that attackers keep reporting false information to the fusion center consistently.
In fact, attackers may attack intermittently while appearing normal during rest periods.
The author proposed a low-complexity sequential 0/1 (S0/1) method for CSS in the presence of strategic Byzantine attacks.
It does not require strong assumptions or any prior knowledge, and this method will be discussed in the next chapter.
With the proliferation of IoT devices and enhanced interconnectivity, attackers may exploit communication vulnerabilities and weaknesses 
between IoT devices to launch future attacks. Attackers may also utilize high-speed, low-latency 5G/6G networks to carry out 
larger-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks as shown in Fig.\ref{fig13}, bypass security measures using network slicing and virtualization technologies, or exploit vulnerabilities in mobile communication protocols to invade devices and systems.
The third type of attack is known as attack model aggregation.
In this type of attack, Byzantine attackers manipulate the model parameters of the participants in order
to influence the aggregation results.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/ddos.jpg}}
    \caption{DDOS attack}
    \label{fig13}
\end{figure}


As discussed by El Mhamdi \cite{b120}, these attacks by Byzantine workers may not prevent the model from converging but can instead
lead to convergence on suboptimal solutions.

Another common type of attack is called Gamber, as described by Cong Xie \cite{b121}.
In this attack, an attacker can modify some of the data communicated between participants.
The attacker randomly selects data and makes malicious changes to them.
A different type of attack is called omniscient.
The attacker needs to have knowledge of the gradients sent by all the staff members.
The attacker then replaces some gradient vectors by taking the sum of all gradients, scaled by large negative values.

The objective is to mislead the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm into moving in the opposite direction with larger step sizes.
Weaker attacks, such as Gaussian attacks, are also possible.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/gause.jpg}}
    \caption{Omniscient attack and Gaussian attack}
    \label{fig14}
\end{figure}

In these attacks, some gradient vectors are replaced with random vectors sampled from a Gaussian distribution that has a large variance.
Such attackers do not require any information from the staff members.
In many applications, multiple sources can provide descriptions of the same object or event, which can inevitably
lead to conflicts in data or information. Resolving conflicts in data is an important challenge in
achieving convergence in federated learning. Qi Li \cite{b122}, Harry Hsu \cite{b123}, and Yanna Jiang \cite{b124} have all
explored questions related to data differences and conflicts.Byzantine attackers have the ability to exploit these
issues in order to manipulate the convergence of the model.
In future attacks, attackers may attempt to achieve their objectives by making modifications to the trained model.

This can involve incorporating backdoors into the model, which would produce incorrect outputs under specific conditions,
or tampering with the model parameters to disrupt its robustness.
In order to evade detection, future attack strategies could involve the development of more advanced and covert
techniques to camouflage malicious modifications. Additionally, malicious insiders who have access to the
model parameters may exploit this privilege to launch attacks. They could manipulate the parameters to
compromise the model's performance or even embed sensitive information within the model itself.
In the coming years, attackers may explore more sophisticated techniques and algorithms to bypass security monitoring and detection mechanisms.
The aim would be to implement internal personnel attacks more efficiently.

These advancements would allow attackers to circumvent existing safeguards and carry out their malicious activities with greater precision and effectiveness.



\section{Defenses against Byzantine Attack}

Based on the different types of Byzantine attacks discussed in the previous chapter, we categorize the Byzantine defense methods into the following classes:
For Sybil attacks, the defense methods include trust-based evaluation methods and machine learning models for detecting fake nodes.


Stephanie Gil \cite{b125} proposed a novel algorithm that analyzes received wireless signals to detect the presence of deceptive clients created by adversaries. I
t does not require specialized hardware or encrypted key exchanges; commercial Wi-Fi cards and software are sufficient.
It utilizes the physical characteristics of wireless signals to "perceive" deceivers.
The author conducted experiments using the AscTec quadcopter server team and iRobot Create ground clients,
demonstrating a deception detection rate exceeding 96 percents.


Blanchard et al. \cite{b126} introduced Krum, which detects and removes outliers in gradient aggregation, allowing convergence
even in the presence of multiple Byzantine attackers, with low complexity.
Luis Muñoz-González \cite{b127} proposed a novel algorithm for robust federated learning called Adaptive Federated Averaging,
aiming to detect faults, attacks, and malicious updates provided by participants in a collaborative model.
The author also proposed a Hidden Markov model to simulate and learn the quality of model updates provided by each participant during training.
Defense methods against Sybil attacks in robot networks have also seen rapid development.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/robot.jpg}}
    \caption{Global consensus on robot trust}
    \label{fig15}
\end{figure}

In Frederik Mallmann-Trenn's work \cite{b128}, a combination of wireless signal analysis and observations
from sociological learning was used to demonstrate rapid convergence of correct trust values
for all robots in the team when facing attacks. All robots develop their own opinions about
network trust by observing messages sent through the network as shown in Fig.\ref{fig15}. They then compare their
opinions with those of their neighbors to reach a consensus on whether the robots
can be trusted. By leveraging their neighbors' opinions, each robot effectively increases
the number of observations available to them about the network, thereby eliminating
messages with a high probability of coming from malicious robots through
cross-validation. Experiments showed that in a limited number of
communication rounds, all robots agreed on the global consensus of trustworthiness in their neighborhood.
Sybil attacks are not easily solved because attackers
can flexibly forge multiple identities, making it challenging
to detect and differentiate false identities.
Therefore, designing secure systems requires considering
multiple defense mechanisms and selecting the most suitable
solutions based on specific application scenarios.


Future prospects for such defense methods mainly focus on the following aspects:
improving identity authentication mechanisms for distinguishing genuine users from Sybil nodes
and establishing more robust trust mechanisms to help identify and filter out Sybil nodes with
malicious behavior. The application of blockchain technology in recent years provides a decentralized,
tamper-resistant, and secure shared ledger that can be used to defend against Sybil attacks.
By integrating identity authentication and trust mechanisms with blockchain technology,
the detection and prevention capabilities of Sybil nodes can be enhanced.


Defense methods against attacks during the transmission process include designing secure communication protocols and encryption mechanisms.
Previous malicious detection and suppression algorithms focused only on simple
"always attack" scenarios, where attackers continuously report false information
to the central entity. In reality, attackers may intermittently attack while
behaving normally at other times. Under the assumption of simple attack strategies,
Ruiliang Chen \cite{b129} proposed sequential hypothesis testing to defend against Byzantine attacks,
but it requires significant computation and prior knowledge.


Therefore, Jun Wu \cite{b119} introduced S0/1 using support vector regression (SVR) to offset strategic
Byzantine attack defense. Even in a blind scenario,
this approach greatly reduces the sample size while providing higher correct sensing ratios.
Luis Muñoz-González \cite{b127} also proposed a robust aggregation
rule that detects and discards malicious or poor local model
updates during each training iteration.
It includes mechanisms for blocking unwanted participants, thereby enhancing computational and communication efficiency.


In traditional federated learning, the performance of models may deteriorate due to variations in data distributions across devices.
To address this issue, Hesham Mostafa (7) proposed a technique called "representation matching."
This technique improves model performance by matching features between the global model
and local models. For clients with homogeneous data distributions, this approach
consistently improves accuracy. For heterogeneous clients, in addition to
improving accuracy, this approach enhances training robustness and avoids
catastrophic training failures without the need for manual hyperparameter tuning for each task.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/de-ddos.jpg}}
    \caption{DDOS defense method of secret moving proxy nodes}
    \label{fig16}
\end{figure}
Huangxin Wang \cite{b131} proposed a mobile target defense mechanism that specifically addresses DDoS
attacks targeting authenticated clients of Internet services.
This mechanism utilizes a set of dynamic and hidden proxies to relay
traffic between authenticated clients and servers. As shown in Fig.\ref{fig16}, by continuously
replacing the attacked proxies with backup proxies and reallocating attacked clients to new proxies,
innocent clients are separated from malicious insiders through a series of shuffling.
In recent years, significant efforts have been made in defending against
low-rate DDoS attacks. Attackers easily launch complex low-rate
DDoS attacks by exploiting prominent features of cloud computing.
Therefore, research on various DDoS attacks and their corresponding defense
methods is crucial in protecting cloud infrastructure from devastating impacts
of DDoS attacks. Neha Agrawal \cite{b132} conducted a comprehensive classification
of all possible variants of cloud DDoS attack solutions and provided detailed insights
into characterization, prevention, detection, and mitigation mechanisms.


In the future, these defense methods can be further developed by constructing more secure and robust encryption protocols and algorithms.
Additionally, more effective identity authentication technologies can be developed to ensure the trustworthiness of communication parties.
Continual improvement and enhancement of transport layer protocols, such as SSL/TLS, can provide stronger security and defense capabilities,
including the ability to resist man-in-the-middle attacks, data tampering, and replay attacks.
The development of real-time threat detection systems capable of detecting and responding to attacks
during the transmission process can also be explored. With the advancement of quantum computing,
traditional encryption algorithms may be threatened.


Therefore, researching and developing
quantum-safe communication protocols and algorithms is important to
ensure security during the transmission process and protect data confidentiality in a quantum computing environment.
Defense methods against model aggregation attacks include designing robust aggregation algorithms and
using differential privacy techniques to protect model parameters.


Qi Li \cite{b122} modeled the problem using an optimization framework where ground truth and
source reliability are defined as two sets of unknown variables. The objective
is to minimize the overall weighted discrepancy between the ground truth and
multiple-source observations, with each source weighted by its reliability.
This framework can incorporate different loss functions to identify features
of various data types and has developed efficient computing methods that
effectively identify the true information among conflicting data sources.


El Mahdi El Mhamdi \cite{b120} argues that mere convergence of the Byzantine resilient rules is not sufficient.
It is possible that Byzantine workers' attacks can lead to convergence to the worst suboptimal solution.
To address this, he proposes a generic enhancement method called Bulyan.
This method significantly reduces the leeway for Byzantine workers, constraining
them within narrow boundaries. For commonly used batch sizes, Bulyan achieves performance comparable to average speed.
Cong Xie \cite{b121} introduces three robust aggregation rules for stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) with low computational costs.
These rules are the first to be theoretically and empirically studied under the non-convex setting, based on median aggregation.
Harry Hsu \cite{b123} presents a method for synthesizing datasets
with continuous identical ranges and provides performance metrics for the federated averaging algorithm.
Experimental results demonstrate that performance deteriorates with distribution differences,
prompting the introduction of a mitigation strategy using server momentum.
It has been shown that using momentum on top of SGD for non-iid problems has
achieved significant success in accelerating network training.
The proposed method suppresses oscillations through the accumulation of gradient history.


Amit Portnoy \cite{b133} proposes a novel method called Byzantine
Robust Client Weighting (BRCW) to minimize the impact of
malicious clients in federated learning. BRCW assigns different
weights to each client based on their credibility and contribution
to the overall model accuracy. During training, the weights are dynamically updated according to
each client's performance and behavior. Unlike previous work, this study considers the sample
size provided by clients as untrustworthy, as it may come from malicious clients.
BRCW exhibits robustness against various forms of attacks, including communication disruptions and data poisoning.


Krishna Pillutla \cite{b134} designs a novel robust aggregation oracle based on classical
geometric medians and demonstrates its robustness in federated learning with limited
heterogeneity, even when up to half of the devices are faulty. The proposed RFA algorithm
outperforms the standard FedAvg in high damage scenarios and nearly matches
FedAvg's performance in low damage scenarios, but with 1-3 times higher communication costs.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/vote.jpg}}
    \caption{DTwo-layer polymerization method}
    \label{fig17}
\end{figure}

Yanna Jiang \cite{b124} introduces the combination of handling imbalanced data and Byzantine attacks
in the context of federated learning for the first time. The concept of an intelligence pool
is proposed to separate the task of judging the shared local model values from the aggregator,
avoiding the limitations of a single criterion through two-layer verification as shown in Fig.\ref{fig17}.
Future prospects for such defense methods will focus on more stringent authentication and
authorization mechanisms, as well as parameter integrity protection. Mechanisms such as
hash algorithms or digital signatures can be adopted to safeguard the integrity of
parameters, preventing tampering during transmission and storage.


Detection of
malicious parameter modifications and corresponding response measures are also required.
By comprehensively applying these methods, the defense capability against malicious parameter
modification attacks can be enhanced, ensuring the security and integrity of systems and applications.




\section{Adversarial Attack}  

Both adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks are techniques used to modify benign testing samples
in order to make models misbehave during the inference process. While adversarial perturbations are sample-agnostic in universal adversarial attacks,
these attacks can appear similar to backdoor attacks. Consequently, researchers who are unfamiliar with backdoor attacks may question their significance,
as these attacks require additional controls on the training process to some extent.
However, despite certain similarities, these attacks have essential differences.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,height=0.6\linewidth]{picture/diff.jpg}}
    \caption{The differences between adversarial attack and backdoor attack}
    \label{fig18}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.\ref{fig18}, firstly, adversarial attackers need to control the inference process to a certain degree
but not the training process of models. They must query the model results or even gradients multiple
times to generate adversarial perturbations by optimization, given a fixed targeted model.
On the other hand, backdoor attackers require modifying certain training stages,
such as data collection and model training, without any additional requirements in the inference process.
Secondly, from the perspective of attacked samples, backdoor attackers use known,
non-optimized perturbations, whereas adversarial attackers require obtaining
them through the optimization process based on the model output.
This optimization in adversarial attacks requires multiple queries,
making them unable to be real-time in many cases.
Finally, the mechanisms of these attacks are fundamentally different.
Adversarial vulnerability results from the differences in behaviors of models and humans,
while backdoor attackers exploit the excessive learning ability of deep neural networks (DNNs)
to establish a latent connection between trigger patterns and target labels.

In federated learning, because the data is not shared among participants,
attackers can use this to generate adversarial samples locally,
then inject them into the data sets of participants, and train
the model with the data of other participants during the training process.

So, how should attacks targeting federated learning be designed?
In centralized learning, FGSM\cite{b99} was initially used to generate adversarial examples.
Let $\theta$ be the parameters of a model, $x$ the input to the model,
$eta$ the perturbation to original input and $||\eta||_\infty \le \epsilon$,
$y$ the targets associated with $x$ (for machine learning tasks that have targets)
and $J(\theta, x, y)$ be the cost used to train the neural network.
We can linearize the cost function around the current value of $\theta$,
obtaining an optimal max-norm constrained pertubation of:
\begin{equation}
    \eta = \epsilon sign(\nabla_x J(\theta,x,y))
\end{equation}

In federated learning, attackers can use FGSM locally to generate
adversarial samples and then inject them into the datasets of some participants
to affect the performance of the entire model.

PGD\cite{b100} is a more powerful adversarial sample generation method,
which generates adversarial samples by iteratively perturbing the input.
Specifically, PGD first randomly generates an initial disturbance $\delta_0$,
and then iteratively updates the disturbance $\delta_t$, to meet the constraint,
that is, $|\delta_t|_{\infty} \leq \epsilon_{\text{max}}$,
where $\epsilon_{\text{max}}$is the maximum value of the disturbance.
After each update, PGD also projects the disturbance
$\delta_t$ back into the constraint space to ensure that it meets the
constraint conditions.
Specifically, the update formula for PGD is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    x^{t+1} = \text{Clip}(x + \text{sign}(\nabla_x L(\theta,x',y)) \cdot \epsilon{\text{max}}, x - \epsilon_{\text{max}}, x + \epsilon_{\text{max}}),
\end{equation}
Where $\text{Clip}$ means to cut $x$ into the interval, and $\epsilon_ {\text{max}} $is the maximum value of the disturbance.
Unlike FGSM, PGD requires multiple iterations to generate adversarial examples,
so attackers need to use the local dataset and model parameters of each participant
to iteratively update the perturbation.

In federated learning, using PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) or FGSM
(Fast Gradient Sign Method) to generate adversarial examples and perform
adversarial attacks is a common method. However, compared to centralized
learning, there are some considerations and techniques that need to be
taken into account.

\subsubsection{Data privacy and distribution heterogeneity}: In federated learning, data is
typically distributed across various edge devices, making it slightly more
difficult to generate adversarial examples and perform attacks. Therefore,
attackers need more complex strategies to adapt to the heterogeneity of the
data distribution. In this case, the generation of adversarial examples should
consider the data distribution and usage on each device. In federated learning,
the amount and quality of data from each participant may vary, leading to
imbalanced training data. This may affect the effectiveness of adversarial attacks,
as attackers may not be able to generate sufficiently accurate adversarial
examples to attack all participants' models.

\subsubsection{Network latency and bandwidth limitations}: In federated learning,
devices communicate through a network, which may result in network
latency or bandwidth limitations. Therefore, when generating adversarial
examples and performing attacks, these factors need to be taken into
consideration. For example, it may be necessary to optimize the size
and generation speed of adversarial examples to adapt to network limitations.
And in federated learning, the training steps of each participant are asynchronous,
which may lead to synchronization issues. For example, attackers may not be able
to perform attacks on all participants' models because they may be at
different training steps or states.

\subsubsection{Update of attack strategies}: Due to the dynamic nature of federated
learning, attackers need to constantly update their attack strategies
to adapt to changes in the learning model and data distribution. This
may require designing more complex attack strategies and using more
efficient optimization algorithms.

\subsubsection{Attack detection and defense}: In federated learning, adversarial
attacks may be easier to detect due to the distribution and usage
of data. Therefore, it is necessary to design adversarial examples
that are more difficult to detect or use more complex attack strategies
to avoid detection.

Overall, using PGD or FGSM to generate adversarial examples and perform
adversarial attacks in federated learning requires considering the
characteristics and limitations of federated learning, including
the heterogeneity of data distribution, network latency and bandwidth
limitations, update of attack strategies, and attack detection and defense.
This may require designing more complex and efficient attack strategies
and adversarial example generation methods.


\section{Defenses against Adversarial Attack}

Overall, progress has been made in defending against adversarial samples.
As adversarial samples share similarities with the previously discussed backdoor
samples, defense methods involving sample filtering can be employed.
However, in this section, we will refrain from discussing filtering methods
and instead focus on the defense method of adversarial training.

Adversarial training is a defense method against adversarial attacks.
Its basic idea is to incorporate adversarial examples into the training process,
enabling the model to better withstand unknown adversarial attacks.
Specifically, adversarial training combines the original training dataset
with adversarial samples generated to target the model, and retrains the
model accordingly. This way, the model encounters adversarial examples
continuously during the learning process, thereby enhancing its robustness
and generalization capability.

FAT (Federated Adversarial Training) is a method proposed in \cite{b31} that
combines federated learning and adversarial training to reduce evasion
threats during inference while preserving data privacy during training.
In the FAT protocol, each device trains a local model and generates adversarial
samples, which are mixed with the original data for training.
The models are then uploaded to the server for aggregation.
This helps to improve the robustness of the model against adversarial attacks.
The authors note that the protocol does not work out of the box and requires careful
tuning of the optimization parameters to achieve good results. Additionally, the authors
acknowledge that the experiments were conducted on idealized federated settings and that
further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of FAT in more realistic scenarios.

So, there are also several challenges with implementing adversarial training in federated learning,
such as heterogeneous clients caused by distribution, certified guarantees, privacy leakage, slow convergence rate.


\subsection{heterogeneous clients caused by distribution}  
The major challenge in federated learning is the heterogeneity of clients.  
This means that the distribution of training data may vary among different clients, 
and the computational resources available to each client may also differ.
The paper\cite{b101} proposes a novel method called FedRobust to address the problem of
distribution shifts in federated learning. FedRobust is a gradient descent ascent
(GDA) algorithm that solves the minimax robust optimization problem and can be
efficiently implemented in a federated setting. This paper show that FedRobust,
which alternates between the perturbation and parameter model variables,
will converge to a stationary point in the minimax objective that satisfies
the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) \cite{b102} condition. This optimization method can be used
to address the issue of distribution shifts in federated learning,
which can significantly impact the performance of the trained model.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth,height=0.4\linewidth]{picture/db.png}}
    \caption{Decision boundary of DBFAT-trainedmodel}
    \label{fig19}
\end{figure}

Zhang et al.\cite{b34} found that the accuracy of the federated learning model with
adversarial training decreases on clean data, especially when the data of different
client are non-independent and identically distributed, so they propose an algorithm
based on decision boundary as shown in Fig.\ref{fig19}, which uses local reweighting and global regularization
to improve the accuracy and robustness in federated adversarial training.
Chen et al.\cite{b32} studies the skewed labels problem in federated learning and proposes
a CalFAT framework to calculate the logits of each class. By using this framework, the models between different clients eventually converge, 
enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the global model.

Hong et al.\cite{b105} have studied the problems caused by clients with different computing resources.
During federated learning, some clients can support adversarial training, but some clients with
lack of computing resources can not support it. This paper studies how to spread resistance robustness
from resource-rich users who can support confrontation training to those users with poor resources.
This paper shows that an effective robust propagation algorithm is proposed by using BN layer technology correctly.  

\subsection{Certified Guarantees}  
Certified guarantees are needed in adversarial training to ensure reliable protection and security against unknown attacks in adversarial environments.
Certified guarantees refer to rigorous proofs and assurances of model performance. 
They provide protection bounds against specific types of attacks, 
indicating that the model can maintain a certain level of performance regardless of how carefully the attacker designs the attack, such as high accuracy or robustness.

By using certified guarantees, adversarial training can provide a degree of predictability and security. 
This means that in practical deployment, there is higher confidence in the model's performance and trustworthiness, 
rather than relying solely on trial-and-error evaluation and protection. 
It offers a more reliable and definitive defense mechanism for models to handle unknown or complex attacks.  

Chen et al.\cite{b104} proposes incorporating randomized smoothing techniques into federated adversarial
training to enable data-private distributed learning with certifiable robustness to test-time adversarial
perturbations. The experiments conducted in the paper show that this approach can deliver models as
robust as those trained by centralized training, and can enable provably-robust classifiers to
2-bounded adversarial perturbations in a distributed setup.

From the perspective of variance-bias decomposition,Chen et al.\cite{b108} decomposed the 
loss function into a combination of bias and variance, generated adversarial samples on the server 
and returned them to each client for adversarial training. Then, they used any model aggregation 
algorithm to improve the global model's adversarial robustness.

\subsection{Privacy leakage} 
As mentioned earlier, privacy protection is crucial in federated learning.
In \cite{b106},it is proved that the model of confrontation training is more prone to
privacy disclosure than the model of normal training.
Zhou et al.\cite{103} argues that conventional federated learning frameworks are vulnerable
to strong adversarial attacks, even if adversarial training using locally
generated adversarial examples is performed on each client. To address this
problem, the paper proposes a new framework called FedBVA (Federated Learning
with Bias-Variance Analysis) that provides a tiny amount of bias-variance
perturbed data from the central server to the clients through asymmetrical
communication. This approach dramatically improves the robustness of the
training model under various settings, without violating the clients' privacy.

\subsection{Slow convergence rate}
As described in \cite{b34}, conducting adversarial training in federated learning is a challenging task because the convergence speed of adversarial training is very slow.
In \cite{b107}, a method was proposed to solve this problem.
Assuming the local iteration number of federated learning is E, this article believes that a larger E will
increase the drift between models and affect the adversarial robustness, but will converge quickly. A smaller
E will increase the adversarial robustness but decrease the convergence efficiency. Therefore, this article
proposes a dynamic mechanism for adjusting E, and uses FedCurv instead of FedAvg as the global aggregation
algorithm, and proposes a new algorithm called FedDynAT to simultaneously improve the convergence
speed and adversarial robustness.


\section{Hrbrid Defenses}
Recently, some works have studied the latent connection between adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks.
For example, Weng et al. \cite{b66}empirically demonstrated that defending
against adversarial attacks via adversarial training may increase the risks of backdoor attacks.
We can introduce sample filtering to prevent backdoor samples from entering the training dataset. 
Then, we can enhance adversarial robustness by introducing adversarial training on the client side. 
When sending gradient information to the server, we can perform malicious gradient filtering to construct a hybrid defense mechanism.
Model distillation can also serve as a hybrid defense mechanism. 
By training a more robust teacher model and using its output as labels to train a student model, 
model distillation can effectively mitigate the impact of backdoor attacks and adversarial sample attacks.
\section{Advanced Research and Problems}  
\subsection{Attack}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Backdoor attackers need to effectively hide backdoors to make them difficult to detect.
    \item Backdoor attackers should use different types of backdoors, such as hardcoding and model parameter optimization.  This paper suggests that using generation techniques to create backdoor samples for dynamic attacks is a solution.
    \item How do Byzantine attackers leverage larger networks to launch attacks while evading detection.  
    \item How to better exploit communication protocol vulnerabilities for device and system intrusion.  
    \item How to improve the transferability of adversarial samples.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Defense}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In federated learning, client data is distributed among multiple participants. It is an important challenge to ensure data privacy while implementing defenses.  
    \item Detecting malicious participants quickly and accurately is a key issue. Existing solutions rely mainly on consistency verification and anomaly detection, but there is still room for improvement in large-scale federated learning scenarios.  
    \item Effective defense mechanisms, such as fault-tolerant algorithms and majority voting, are needed to counter Byzantine attacks. However, these mechanisms need to strike a balance with factors like privacy preservation and computational efficiency.
    \item Adversarial training can enhance model robustness but may compromise generalization capability. Balancing the trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization is a problem that requires exploration and resolution.
    \item Designing models that can withstand zero-knowledge adversarial sample attacks remains an open question. It demands models to possess robustness without prior knowledge of adversarial samples during training.
\end{itemize}



\section{Conclusion}
In this survey, we systematically introduce state-of-the-art threats in federated learning systems,
which mainly include byzantine attacks, backdoor attacks and adversarial attacks. 
And we also detailed describe corresponding defensive policies.
Additionally, we discuss a number of open problems of current defense methods,
hoping it could help researchers identify and solve issues more quickly in the area of robust federated learning.
